My name is Usama Bin Mubarak, and I live in Faisalabad. I have recently completed my graduation in the field of psychology from Government College University Faisalabad. Following my graduation, I worked as a trainee psychologist, where I applied my theoretical knowledge in practical settings. This role allowed me to gain valuable hands-on experience in assessing, diagnosing, and providing therapeutic interventions to individuals facing various psychological challenges. Working directly with clients reinforced my empathy, communication skills, and the ability to develop tailored treatment plans to meet their unique needs.
While psychology has been a significant part of my academic and professional life, I have always been passionate about technology, especially AI and programming. My interest in technology began during my university years when I started exploring different aspects of web development. I acquired knowledge of platforms such as WordPress and Shopify, which enabled me to design and create websites.
My goal is to merge my knowledge of psychology with my passion for AI and programming to create innovative solutions that address real-world problems. I am particularly interested in exploring how AI can be helpful to enhance mental health care, develop personalized therapeutic interventions, and improve overall well-being.
In conclusion, I am a psychology graduate with a passion for technology, particularly in AI and programming.I look forward to the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead, and I am confident that my unique background will enable me to make meaningful contributions to the fields of psychology and technology.
