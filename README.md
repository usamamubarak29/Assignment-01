My name is Usama Bin Mubarak, I have recently completed my graduation in the field of psychology from Government College University Faisalabad. Following my graduation, I worked as a trainee psychologist, where I applied my theoretical knowledge in practical settings. This role allowed me to gain valuable hands-on experience in assessing, diagnosing, and providing therapeutic interventions to individuals facing various psychological challenges. Working directly with clients reinforced my empathy, communication skills, and the ability to develop tailored treatment plans to meet their unique needs.
